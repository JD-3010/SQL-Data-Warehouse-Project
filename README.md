# SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project
A comprehensive project that demonstrates my end-to-end experience in building a modern data warehouse using SQL Server. It covers designing efficient data models, implementing robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and creating analytics-ready datasets to support data-driven decision-making.
